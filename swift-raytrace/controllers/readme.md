#  Summary

Contains modules representing controllers used by the app.

## What are Controllers?

Controllers take user input and transform those into valid commands to the application. These can be commands to the views (to change what the view is displaying, for instance), or commands to models (to change program state). Controllers are decoupled from both views and models to decouple the act of validating and converting input from program state/rendering.
